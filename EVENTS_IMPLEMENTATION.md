  role: "1st Place - Winner",
  startDate: "event_start",
  endDate: "event_end",
  tags: ["event", "tags"],
  attachments: ["certificates"],
  verified: true,              // ✅ Auto-verified
  verifiedBy: "Admin Name",    // ✅ Verifier recorded
  verifierComment: "Auto-verified: Created from institutional event...",
  isPublic: true
}
```
