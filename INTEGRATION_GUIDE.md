# Integration with Existing System

## Overview
The Events System seamlessly integrates with your existing TruePort backend. Here's how it fits into your current architecture.

---

## Architecture Integration

### Database (MongoDB)
- **New Collection**: `events` (created automatically by Mongoose)
- **Existing Collections**: Uses `users`, `experiences`, `instituteadmins`
- **No migrations needed**: System creates collections on first use

### Authentication
- ✅ Uses existing JWT authentication
- ✅ Uses existing admin auth middleware (`requireInstituteAdmin`)
- ✅ Uses existing user auth middleware (`requireAuth`)
- ✅ Added new middleware: `requireAdminOrVerifier` (both can manage events)

### Models Integration
```
Event → User (participants)
Event → Experience (created experiences)
Event → InstituteAdmin (created by)
```

### Routes Integration
```
/api/events              → New routes (registered in server.js)
/api/institute-admin     → Existing (admins can create events)
/api/auth                → Existing (verifiers can create events)
/api/experiences         → Existing (events create experiences)
```

---

## How It Works with Existing Features

### 1. User Roles
**Existing Roles:**
- STUDENT
- VERIFIER
- INSTITUTE_ADMIN
- SUPER_ADMIN

**Who Can Use Events:**
- ✅ `INSTITUTE_ADMIN` - Full access to events
- ✅ `VERIFIER` (teachers/faculty) - Full access to events
- ✅ `STUDENT` - Read-only access to public events
- ❌ `SUPER_ADMIN` - Not intended for event creation (but can be added)

### 2. Institution Isolation
**Existing System:**
- Users belong to one institution
- Verifications are institution-specific
- Admins manage their institution only

**Events System:**
- ✅ Events belong to one institution
- ✅ Only students from same institution can be added
- ✅ Admins/Verifiers see only their institution's events
- ✅ Complete data isolation

### 3. Experience Creation
**Existing Flow:**
```
Student creates experience → 
Uploads proof → 
Requests verification → 
Verifier reviews → 
Verifier approves/rejects
```

**New Events Flow:**
```
Admin creates event → 
Adds participants → 
Pushes verified experiences →
✅ Experiences instantly appear in student portfolios (verified)
```

**Coexistence:**
- ✅ Both flows work simultaneously
- ✅ Students can still manually create experiences
- ✅ Events provide an admin-initiated alternative
- ✅ Verified experiences from events clearly marked

## Database Schema

### Event Model Fields
```javascript
{
  title: String,
  description: String,
  eventType: Enum, // COMPETITION, HACKATHON, WORKSHOP, etc.
  institution: String, // Matches User.institute
  organizer: { name, email },
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  location: String,
  tags: [String],
  attachments: [String], // Cloudinary URLs
  awards: [{ position, title, description }],
  
  participants: [{
    userId: ObjectId → User,
    role: String,
    position: String,
    teamName: String,
    certificate: String,
    experienceCreated: Boolean,
    experienceId: ObjectId → Experience
  }],
  
  createdBy: {
    adminId: ObjectId,
    adminType: 'INSTITUTE_ADMIN' | 'VERIFIER',
    name: String,
    email: String
  },
  
  status: 'DRAFT' | 'PUBLISHED' | 'COMPLETED' | 'CANCELLED',
  isPublic: Boolean,
  experiencesPushedCount: Number,
  experiencesPushedAt: Date
}
```

### Experience Model (Enhanced)
When created from an event, experience includes:
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  verified: true, // Auto-verified
  verifiedBy: "Admin Name",
  verifierComment: "Auto-verified: Created from institutional event 'Event Title'"
}
```

## API Endpoints Overview

### New Endpoints (Events)
```

const requireAdminOrVerifier = ... // New middleware for both roles
```

### 2. Models (Already Integrated)
```javascript
// src/models/Event.js (New)
const Event = require('./models/Event');

// Uses existing models:
const User = require('./models/User');
const Experience = require('./models/Experience');
const InstituteAdmin = require('./models/InstituteAdmin');
```

### 3. Server Routes (Already Integrated)
```javascript
// src/server.js
const eventRoutes = require('./routes/events'); // Added
app.use('/api/events', eventRoutes); // Added
```

---

## Testing Integration

### Unit Tests (Can Add)
```javascript
// test/events.test.js
describe('Events API', () => {
  it('should create event as institute admin', async () => {
    // Test event creation
  });
  
  it('should add participants to event', async () => {
    // Test adding participants
  });
  
  it('should push verified experiences', async () => {
    // Test experience creation
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
Use existing test framework (if any) or Postman collection

## Deployment Checklist

### Database
- [ ] No migrations needed (automatic)
- [ ] Ensure MongoDB connection works
- [ ] Indexes created automatically

### Environment Variables
- [ ] No new variables needed
- [ ] Uses existing JWT_SECRET
- [ ] Uses existing MONGODB_URI

### Dependencies
- [ ] All dependencies already installed
- [ ] No new packages needed

### Testing
- [ ] Test with Postman collection
- [ ] Verify admin can create events
- [ ] Verify verifier can create events
- [ ] Verify experiences are created
- [ ] Verify student can view events

### Monitoring
- [ ] Check server logs
- [ ] Monitor event creation
- [ ] Monitor experience creation
- [ ] Track any errors

---

## Backwards Compatibility

✅ **Fully Compatible**
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- No modifications to existing models
- No changes to existing routes
- New routes don't conflict with existing ones

✅ **Safe to Deploy**
- Can be deployed alongside existing system
- No data migration required
- No downtime needed
- Can be disabled by removing route registration

---

## Rollback Plan

If needed, to rollback:
1. Comment out in `src/server.js`:
   ```javascript
   // const eventRoutes = require('./routes/events');
   // app.use('/api/events', eventRoutes);
   ```
2. Restart server
3. Events collection remains but is unused
4. No impact on existing experiences

To fully remove:
1. Delete files:
   - `src/models/Event.js`
   - `src/routes/events.js`
2. Drop collection (optional):
   ```javascript
   db.events.drop()
   ```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Queries
- Events indexed by institution, status, date
- Participants indexed by userId
- Uses pagination for lists

### Bulk Operations
- Push experiences uses async/await with error handling
- Processes participants in sequence to avoid overwhelming DB
- Returns detailed results for monitoring

### Caching (Future Enhancement)
- Can add Redis caching for public events
- Can cache institution's events list
- Can cache user's events

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
✅ All routes require authentication
✅ Uses existing JWT system
✅ Token verification on every request

### Authorization
✅ Institution-based isolation
✅ Role-based access control
✅ Participant validation (must be from same institution)

### Data Validation
✅ Mongoose schema validation
✅ Required field validation
✅ Date validation (end date after start date)
✅ URL validation for attachments

### Input Sanitization
✅ Trim strings
✅ Max length validation
✅ Email format validation
✅ Array validation for participants

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Metrics to Track
- Number of events created per institution
- Number of experiences pushed
- Success/failure rates
- Most popular event types
- Average participants per event

### Logs
```javascript
console.log('Event created:', eventId);
console.log('Experiences pushed:', successCount);
console.log('Failed to push:', failedCount);
```

### Dashboard Stats (Can Add)
```
Institution Dashboard:
- Total Events: 45
- Events This Month: 12
- Experiences Pushed: 523
- Participants: 234 students
```

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### 1. Email Notifications
```javascript
// When experience is pushed
await sendEmail({
  to: student.email,
  subject: 'New Verified Experience Added',
  template: 'experience-added',
  data: { eventTitle, position }
});
```

### 2. Event Templates
```javascript
// Predefined event templates
const templates = {
  hackathon: { /* preset fields */ },
  workshop: { /* preset fields */ },
  competition: { /* preset fields */ }
};
```

### 3. QR Code Generation
```javascript
// Generate QR for event attendance
const qrCode = await generateQR(eventId);
```

### 4. Calendar Integration
```javascript
// Export to Google Calendar, iCal
GET /api/events/:id/calendar.ics
```

### 5. Analytics Dashboard
```javascript
// Event statistics
GET /api/events/analytics
```

### 6. Batch Operations
```javascript
// Bulk event creation from CSV
POST /api/events/bulk-import
```
