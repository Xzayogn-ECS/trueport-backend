## 💻 How to Use

### Quick Start (3 Steps)

```bash
# 1. Login as Admin or Teacher
POST /api/institute-admin/login
# or
POST /api/auth/login  # for teacher (VERIFIER role)

# 2. Create Event & Add Students
POST /api/events
POST /api/events/{eventId}/participants

POST /api/events/{eventId}/push-experiences

# Done! Students have verified experiences ✅
```

### Example Usage

```javascript
// 1. Create Competition
{
  "title": "Coding Championship 2025",
  "eventType": "COMPETITION",
  "startDate": "2025-03-15",
  "awards": [
    {"position": "1st Place", "title": "Champion"},
    {"position": "2nd Place", "title": "Runner Up"}
  ]
}

// 2. Add Winners
{
  "participants": [
    {"userId": "alice_id", "position": "1st Place", "role": "Winner"},

```

## 🎯 Benefits

### Time Savings

- Admin creates event → Adds participants → Clicks "Push Experiences"
- ⏱️ **Time: Minutes**

### Efficiency
- ✅ Bulk operations (add 100+ students at once)
- ✅ One-click verified experiences
- ✅ No follow-up needed
- ✅ Consistent formatting

### Quality
- ✅ Professional documentation
- ✅ Institutional backing
- ✅ No student errors
- ✅ Complete records

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

| Feature | Institute Admin | Teacher/Verifier | Student |
|---------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| Create events | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Add participants | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Push experiences | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View all events | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View public events | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View own events | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Institution Isolation:**
- Each institution's data is completely separate
- Admins/Teachers can only access their institution's events
- Students can only be added from the same institution

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Option 1: Postman (Recommended)
```bash
# Import the collection
postman/TruePort-Events-API.postman_collection.json

# Set variables and run tests
```

### Option 2: cURL
```bash
# See examples/events-examples.js for complete commands

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/institute-admin/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@university.edu","password":"password"}'

# Create Event
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Tech Fest","eventType":"COMPETITION",...}'

# Push Experiences
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/events/$EVENT_ID/push-experiences \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Option 3: JavaScript Examples
```javascript
const { completeWorkflow } = require('./examples/events-examples');
completeWorkflow();
```

---

## 📊 What Gets Created

When you push experiences, each student receives:

```javascript
Experience Entry {
  title: "Event Title",
  description: "Event description\n\nPosition/Award: 1st Place\n\nTeam: Code Warriors",
  role: "1st Place - Winner",
  startDate: event.startDate,
  endDate: event.endDate,
  tags: ["event", "tags"],
  attachments: ["certificate.pdf", "event-banner.jpg"],
  
  ✅ verified: true,
  ✅ verifiedBy: "Admin Name",
  ✅ verifiedAt: Date,
  ✅ verifierComment: "Auto-verified: Created from institutional event 'Event Title'",
  
  isPublic: true
}
