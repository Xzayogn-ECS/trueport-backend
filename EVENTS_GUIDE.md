## Best Practices

### 1. Start with DRAFT Status
Create events as DRAFT, add all participants, then change to PUBLISHED:
```javascript
// Create as draft
{ "status": "DRAFT" }

// After adding participants, publish
PUT /api/events/{id}
{ "status": "PUBLISHED" }
```

### 2. Add Participants Before Pushing
Always add all participants before pushing experiences:
```javascript
// ‚ùå Wrong order
POST /api/events/{id}/push-experiences
POST /api/events/{id}/participants

// ‚úÖ Correct order
POST /api/events/{id}/participants
POST /api/events/{id}/push-experiences
```

### 3. Use Descriptive Roles and Positions
```javascript
// ‚ùå Vague
{ "role": "Student", "position": "1" }

// ‚úÖ Clear
{ "role": "Winner", "position": "1st Place - Best Innovation" }
```

### 4. Include Tags for Searchability
```javascript
{
  "tags": ["AI", "Machine Learning", "Python", "Competition"]
}
```

### 5. Upload Certificates Before Pushing
```javascript
{
  "attachments": ["https://cloudinary.com/event-cert.pdf"],
  "participants": [
    { "userId": "...", "certificate": "https://cloudinary.com/individual-cert.pdf" }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "User does not belong to your institution"
- You can only add students from your own institution
- Verify the student's institute field matches yours

### "Participant not found in event"
- The user hasn't been added to the event yet
- Use GET /api/events/:id to check current participants

### "Experience already exists"
- The system has already created an experience for this participant
- Check the response details for skipped students
- Use GET /api/events/:id to see experienceCreated status

### Experiences not showing for students
- Ensure you called the push-experiences endpoint
- Check that the event status allows experience creation
- Verify students are properly added as participants

---

## Students' Perspective

### What Students See

1. **Public Events**: All published events are visible
   - GET `/api/events/public/list`

2. **My Events**: Events where they are participants
   - GET `/api/events/my/events`

3. **Automatic Experiences**: When you push experiences:
   - Appears in their portfolio immediately
   - Marked as verified (no action needed)
   - Includes all details (position, team, certificates)
   - Ready to showcase to recruiters

### Student Benefits
- ‚úÖ No manual entry needed
- ‚úÖ Instant verification
- ‚úÖ Professional documentation
- ‚úÖ Consistent formatting
- ‚úÖ Official institutional backing

## Migration from Manual Verification

### Before (Manual Process):
1. Student creates experience
2. Student uploads proof
3. Verifier reviews request
4. Verifier approves/rejects
5. Student gets notification
‚è±Ô∏è **Time: Days/Weeks**

### After (Events System):
1. Admin creates event
2. Admin adds participants
3. Admin pushes experiences
‚úÖ **Time: Minutes**
üéØ **Auto-verified, no student action needed**

---
